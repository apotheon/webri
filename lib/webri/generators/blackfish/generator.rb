module WebRI

  # Blackfish is based on Vladimir Kolesnikov's SDoc
  # (Copyright (c) 2009 Vladimir Kolesnikov).
  #
  # The SDoc code base was helpful in understanding how to
  # build an RDoc generator. It was convenient to keep a
  # copy in with the WebRI code for reference. Later, it was 
  # easy enough to integrate it with the rest of WebRI
  # (eg. splitting Search into a separate component),
  # and so it has stayed as an alernate template with
  # a few style modifications.

= WebRI TODO

== One File

An idea for a future version... generate all the html into
a single file, then use CSS and JQeury to completely control
presentation. That would be pretty cool, as it would mean
the entire set of documentation is on a single file.

The only problem with this design is that it would mean
we could not use realtime serving of the docs, like we
can now using Webrik b/c large programs, like Rails and
Ruby itself, take a considerable amount of time to generate,
something like 30 minutes to an hour.

However, shortcomings aside, this might be a great way to
go. The dynamic server is already a bit slow anyway b/c
ri itself is slow, and in practice I have found that end
up utilizing the generated output in the long run. The
dynamic site I use only for debugging.

Hmmm... Ok. So how about I add it as an additional option.

[NOTE: This is almost done, but all the generation code
could use bit of reworking to make the code all "pretty".]

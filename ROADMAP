= WebRI ROADMAP

== Current Ideas

* Need a template geared toward tiny projects, that have only a single class
and/or a few methods. Probably it would a single page site using the README
and an embedded code section.

* Would like to change to a Rack server instead of the Webrick server.

* Incoporate firefox keyword mode? (see MGeorgi Blog)


== Toward Version 2.0

* I am looking at making the next major version of WebRI
a full AJAX solution. All parsed documentation from RDoc
will be organized into JSON files with which the HTML5/jQuery
templates will use to build up the site client-side.

* This has the advantage that an update mode can replace
the JSON files without replacing the the templates, allowing
per-project manual design adjustments.

* This course has not been pursued yet b/c at the very least
the template system I'd like to use (Jam) is not quite
ready. I hope to have it ready soon. But if it doesn't pan
then we will use a simple jQuery based system akin to ERB.


== Toward Version 3.0

* This may entail forking the RI porition of RDoc and expanding
it to generate JSON in addition to YAML, which WebRI could
then use. In doing so maybe we can make RI faster.

* This will effect the interface of the webri tool, to be like
that of the current webri-server tool, expect that an output
option would be used. Eg.

  $ webri -o doc/webri doc/ri

* This will also allow for complete harmonization between the ri-server
with the rdoc generators, so that the ri-server can use any of the
template formats.

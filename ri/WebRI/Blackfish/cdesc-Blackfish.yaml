  body: Blackfish is based on Vladimir Kolesnikov's SDoc (Copyright (c) 2009 Vladimir Kolesnikov).
- !ruby/struct:RDoc::Markup::Flow::P 
  body: The SDoc code base was helpful in understanding how to build an RDoc generator. It was convenient to keep a copy in with the WebRI code for reference. Later, it was easy enough to integrate it with the rest of WebRI (eg. splitting Search into a separate component), and so it has stayed as an alernate template with a few style modifications.

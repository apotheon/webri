== DESCRIPTION

WebRI is a dynamic web-based ri-browser which can provided
ri documentation dynamically, by running a webrick server.

Presently WebRI utilizes ri's own html output mode to produce
web pages.


== RELEASE NOTES

Please see the HISTORY file.


== USAGE SYNOPSIS

WebRI can be used as a dynamic ri browser, either for a single project
or for a collection of libraries. Indeed, the WebRI server can be used
to browse the entire installed object system --eveything documented in
your central install locations. To do the later, simply execute
<tt>webri-server</tt> with no arguments and open a webrowser to 
the local port designated (see below).

  $ webr-server

To browse per-project ri documentation, you will first need to locate
the project's ri files, either by locating them in your system installation
or by generating them for a project, which can be done using rdoc, eg.

  $ rdoc --ri --op "doc/ri" lib/

Sometimes a package will include a convenience script for generating these.
Try running 'rake -T', or look for a 'script/' or 'task/' executable that does
the job. Usually the generated documentation is placed in either ri/ or doc/ri/.
I will use doc/ri/ in the following example, adjust your directory as needed.

With ri files loacted you can view them with:

  $ webri-server doc/ri

You will see a Webrick server start up, informing you of the port being used.

  [2008-03-28 12:11:16] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1
  [2008-03-28 12:11:16] INFO  ruby 1.8.6 (2007-06-07) [x86_64-linux]
  [2008-03-28 12:11:21] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=8870 port=8888

In this example we see the port is the default 8888. Simply open your browser and
navigate to:

  http://localhost:8888/

On the left side of the screen you will see a navigation tree, and the right side
contans an infromation panel.

NOTE: Becuase <tt>ri</tt> itself isn't very fast, if you use WebRI against the
entire set of installed Ruby libraries it can take a few seconds to load up.
(Sure wish FastRI turned out for the better.)


== INSTALLATION

Installing via RubyGems is per the usual:

  $ sudo gem install webri

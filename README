= Web RI

  http://webri.rubyforge.org

Webrick-based RI browser

== Usage

=== Generate RI Docs

WebRI can be used to browse the entire installed object system --eveything
documented in one of the central RI locations.

WebRI can also be used (and this is probably more useful) to browse per-project
RI documentation. Simply generate the RI docs by navigating to the projects
root directory and running:

  rdoc --ri --op "doc/ri" lib

Sometimes a package will include a convenience script for generating these.
Try running 'rake -T', or look for a 'script/' or 'task/' executable that does
the job. Usually the generated documentation is placed in either ri/ or doc/ri/.
I will use doc/ri/ in the following example, sicen that is my preference. Adjust
your directory as needed.

=== Using Webri to View Them

With ri docs generated, you can view them with:

  $ webri doc/ri

You will see a Webrick server start up, informing you of the port being used.

  [2008-03-28 12:11:16] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1
  [2008-03-28 12:11:16] INFO  ruby 1.8.6 (2007-06-07) [x86_64-linux]
  [2008-03-28 12:11:21] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=8870 port=8888

In this example we see the port is the default 8888. Simply open your browser and
navigate to:

  http://localhost:8888/

On the left side of the screen you will see a navigation tree, and the right side
contans an infromation panel.

NOTE: Becuase RI itself isn't very fast, if you use WebRI against the entire set
of installed Ruby libraries it can take a few seconds to load up. (Sure wish
FastRI turned out for the better.)

=== Generating Static Output

You can generate a static set of pages for offline viewing by specifying
and +output+ option.

  webri -o doc/webri doc/ri

This will create a number of files in the doc/webri directory. Open
+doc/webri/index.html+ to view them.

[ed-- Not yet ready for use]
There is also a one page generation mode, where the entire set of specified
ridocs will be placed in a single file.

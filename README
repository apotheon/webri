== DESCRIPTION

Webri is a web-based ri browser. It can provided ri documentation dynamically,
by running a webrick server, or it can generate static pages.

== USAGE

=== Generate RI Docs

WebRI can be used to browse the entire installed object system --eveything
documented in one of the central RI locations.

WebRI can also be used (and this is probably more useful) to browse per-project
RI documentation. Simply generate the RI docs by navigating to the projects
root directory and running:

  $ rdoc --ri --op "doc/ri" lib

Sometimes a package will include a convenience script for generating these.
Try running 'rake -T', or look for a 'script/' or 'task/' executable that does
the job. Usually the generated documentation is placed in either ri/ or doc/ri/.
I will use doc/ri/ in the following example, sicen that is my preference. Adjust
your directory as needed.

=== Using Webri to View Them

With ri docs generated, you can view them with:

  $ webri doc/ri

You will see a Webrick server start up, informing you of the port being used.

  [2008-03-28 12:11:16] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1
  [2008-03-28 12:11:16] INFO  ruby 1.8.6 (2007-06-07) [x86_64-linux]
  [2008-03-28 12:11:21] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=8870 port=8888

In this example we see the port is the default 8888. Simply open your browser and
navigate to:

  http://localhost:8888/

On the left side of the screen you will see a navigation tree, and the right side
contans an infromation panel.

NOTE: Becuase RI itself isn't very fast, if you use WebRI against the entire set
of installed Ruby libraries it can take a few seconds to load up. (Sure wish
FastRI turned out for the better.)

=== Generating Static Output

You can generate a static set of pages for offline viewing by specifying
and +output+ option.

  $ webri -o doc/webri doc/ri

This will create a number of files in the doc/webri directory. Open
+doc/webri/index.html+ to view them.

[ed-- Not yet ready for use]
There is also a one page generation mode, where the entire set of specified
ridocs will be placed in a single file.


== INSTALLATION

Installation using RubyGems:

  $ sudo gem install webri


== ROADMAP

Currently Webri churns through a libraries entries one at a time, calling ri on the backend
again and again. This makes Webri fairly slow. Now that RDoc templates are becoming much easier
create, Webri may well be transformed into an RDoc template. It's just a matter of figuring
out how to use a different formatter other than Darkfish. Once that happens, Webri the program
will migrate into a web-browser extension (Firefox in particular).

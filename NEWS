This is the initial release of WebRI.

I threw this together as a proof of concept, but it
turns out to already be quite usable. I'll add missing
features and clean it up as time permits. Same goes for
the website.

Becuase RI itself isn't very fast, if you use WebRI
against the entire set of installed Ruby libraries
it can take a few seconds to load up. It would be nice
to use FastRI instead, for speed, but FastRI does not
support HTML output as of yet.
